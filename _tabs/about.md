## Hi there!

I am **Giulia**, nice to meet you!

I am currently working as a Developer Relations Communications Manager at Dynatrace, which is a perfect role that combines my curiosity and enthusiasm for tech with my background as a linguist and content creator. 

But it's not just that - I am also pursuing a Master's degree in Content Strategy at the University of Applied Sciences Joanneum in Graz, Austria. 

I live with my husband and daughter in Southern Styria, and we spend a lot of our time travelling between Italy and UK, where I come from, and Slovenia, where he comes from. We are raising our child quadrilingual, since we speak so many languages at home. 

When I'm not working, studying, or taking care of the little one, I like to go out [photographing](https://giuandtom.lightfolio.com/) or stay at home in my workshop to work on sewing projects.
